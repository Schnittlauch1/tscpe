# TSCPE
TSCPE stands for Type-Script-Colour-Personal-Emulator and is an emulator for the CPC464 system written in typescript. 
It uses electron as frontend and is mostly for educating myself and its quite fun working on it.
If you find yourself seeing this project as useful for you, go ahead.

For now its barely working, sluggish documented and not usable at all. 

So, have a nice day =)
